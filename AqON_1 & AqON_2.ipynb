    "## Brief summary: \n",
    "Solubility, a crucial concept, is defined as the maximum quantity of solute capable of dissolving in a specific volume of solvent to produce a saturated solution at a designated temperature—typically room temperature. A fundamental guiding principle is \"like dissolves like,\" signifying that molecules sharing similar polarities and intermolecular forces exhibit a greater tendency to dissolve in one another.The significance of water solubility extends into the realm of drug discovery, directly impacting bioavailability. Bioavailability, the measure of a drug's absorption and its ability to reach the intended target site, hinges on the solubility characteristics of the compound. Notably, the execution of a biological assay becomes impractical if a compound fails to dissolve effectively in water.Recognizing this connection, our approach employs the 208 molecular descriptors and AVALON fingerprint, which is  RDKit molecular quantitative representations of molecular structures as input features for predicting aqueous solubility.\n",
    "         With the aid of train/ test split our model, using a random_state of 123 was divided into 80% for train set and 20% for test set."
